<h1>Biters</h1>

<img src="../../image/Biter.jpg" alt="a scare biter zombie"/>

<p> Biters are victims of the Harran virus who have been symptomatic for a long period of time, resulting in significant degradation of their bodies resulting in major loss of movement speed and coordination. They form the majority of the shambling infected throughout Harran. Like other infected, they will react to, and eat, the living. They are visually distinguished from Virals by their partly or significantly rotted bodies, as well as their complete hair loss. They attack with wide, flailing swings or by grappling and biting their target<p/>

<p> Biters are most dangerous in groups where their slow speed is less of a disadvantage. Biters are also fairly quiet at a distance and can be difficult to spot in darker or noisier areas, but can be heard by their heavy breathing and moaning when up close. It also seems that certain biters have a yellow or greenish mist about them. If hit by fire-type weapons, these Biters have a tendency to explode, causing a small amount of damage to the player and attract the attention of other infected . "Toxic" Biters always vomit when killed by the melee throw ability and most other attacks, while regular Biters, when hit by a toxic weapon, tend to vomit when killed. This vomit can cause acidic damage over time if Crane comes in very close contact with it. Furthermore, their attacks can deal acidic damage over time. Normal Biters can also become toxic Biters if they walk through a chemical spill, although in most cases this also kills the Biter in a very short amount of time.</p>
